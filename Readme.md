# AWS Sandbox

Collection of random samples for AWS Javascript SDK

## How to Run

Create a file `.env` in the project root with the contents as shown below. Run each sample
individually via `node`, e.g. `node s3upload.js`. 

Warning: Files are small, but running some the samples here might still result in real cost!

```bash
# .env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${your_aws_access_key}
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${your_secret_access_key}
AWS_S3_BUCKET=${your_bucket_name}
```
